# assets

This directory centralizes all static assets, including stylesheets, scripts, and media, that power the "Syntax & Empathy Companion" site.

## Overview

This `assets` directory serves as the central hub for all static resources required by the "Syntax & Empathy Companion" Jekyll site. It organizes various files like CSS, JavaScript, and potentially images or fonts, ensuring a clear separation from content files. Its purpose is to maintain site aesthetics, interactivity, and overall user experience, making it crucial for the site's visual presentation and functionality.

## Contents

- **css/** - Contains all stylesheets responsible for the site's design, layout, and visual theming.

## Structure

The `assets` directory is organized by content type to ensure easy access and management of static files. Each subdirectory groups related assets (e.g., all CSS files in `css/`). This thematic organization supports efficient development and maintenance, allowing designers and developers to quickly locate and modify specific asset types.

**Naming Convention:** Subdirectories are named descriptively based on the type of asset they contain (e.g., `css`, `js`, `img`). Files within these subdirectories follow standard web development naming conventions.

**Content Types:** This directory primarily contains stylesheets (`.css`), and is structured to eventually house JavaScript files (`.js`), and potentially images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) or web fonts (`.woff`, `.woff2`).

## Navigation

To explore the site's styling, start by examining the `css/` subdirectory. Each subdirectory within `assets/` contains specific types of resources. For detailed information on any particular asset type, navigate into its respective subdirectory.
