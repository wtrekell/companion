# 02-assets

This directory contains all visual assets, such as images and diagrams, used within the "Git & GitHub Setup for Designers" article.

## Overview

This directory serves as the centralized repository for all visual assets that accompany the `251012-git-github-setup` article. Its purpose is to organize and manage the illustrative content, ensuring easy access and version control for images and diagrams that explain complex Git and GitHub concepts. Visitors, especially those contributing to or maintaining the article, can use this directory to locate, review, or update the visuals referenced within the main article content.

## Contents

-   **leonardo/** - Visual assets specifically generated using Leonardo.ai, illustrating various Git commands, GitHub interface elements, and workflow diagrams.
-   **midjourney/** - Visual assets specifically generated using Midjourney, providing alternative or supplementary illustrations for Git and GitHub setup processes.

## Structure

The subdirectories within `02-assets/` are organized thematically by the AI tool used for generating the visual content. This allows for clear attribution and differentiation of asset styles and origins. Each subdirectory contains the image files pertinent to its respective generation tool.

**Naming Convention:** Subdirectories are named after the AI platform used for asset creation (e.g., `leonardo/`, `midjourney/`). Individual asset files within these subdirectories typically use descriptive filenames to indicate their content.

**Content Types:** Primarily image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) depicting screenshots, conceptual diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrative graphics related to Git and GitHub workflows.

## Navigation

To explore the visual assets, navigate into either the `leonardo/` or `midjourney/` subdirectories. Each contains a collection of images. If you are looking for a specific type of visual, it is recommended to browse both subdirectories as they offer different stylistic interpretations and might cover slightly different aspects of the setup process.
