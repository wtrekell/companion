# raw

Contains initial drafts, unformatted content, and early-stage articles for the "Syntax & Empathy Companion" site.

## Overview

This directory serves as a staging ground for articles and content pieces that are still in their early development stages. It holds unpolished drafts, research notes, and initial content ideas before they are refined, formatted, and moved to other directories for publication or further review. It reflects the iterative process of content creation within the repository, providing transparency into the content development workflow.

## Contents

- **25####-claude-code-preview/** - An early draft or research piece exploring the integration or preview capabilities of code within AI models, specifically Claude. The `####` indicates a placeholder for a specific date or unique identifier.

## Structure

Subdirectories are organized by individual article projects or distinct content pieces. Each subdirectory represents an article in its nascent form, containing all associated draft materials.

**Naming Convention:** Directories generally follow a `[YY####]-topic-slug/` pattern, where `YY` represents the year (e.g., `25` for 2025) and `####` is a unique identifier or a placeholder for a specific date (e.g., `MMDD`). The `topic-slug` provides a clear, descriptive title for the article.

**Content Types:** Visitors will primarily find markdown files (`.md`), research notes, initial outlines, unformatted text, and potentially supporting assets (images, code snippets) related to specific article drafts.

## Navigation

This directory is primarily intended for contributors and those interested in the content development process. It is recommended to explore individual subdirectories for specific draft articles. Each subdirectory may contain its own `README.md` for more detailed context on that particular draft.
