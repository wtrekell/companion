# 01-Input: AI Experiment for Document Metrics

This directory provides the foundational input materials, including experimental design, AI interaction logs, and Python scripts, for an exploration into AI's capability to generate code for document version comparison and human contribution metrics.

## Summary

This directory serves as the comprehensive repository for the source materials and experimental records underpinning an investigation into AI's role in technical workflows. It meticulously documents an experiment where AI was tasked with generating Python code for a document metrics system, including version comparison and human contribution analysis. Visitors will find the initial hypothesis, extensive interaction logs detailing AI prompting and debugging, and the actual Python scripts. This content is essential for understanding the practical methodology and raw data that inform the broader discussions on AI collaboration within design and technology.

## About This Content

This content explores the practical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in generating functional Python code for specific technical tasks, particularly in the domain of document version comparison and human contribution metrics. The primary question addressed is whether AI can reliably produce complex code for a metrics system outside the user's domain expertise, minimizing the need for manual debugging or deep language understanding.

The approach involves a hands-on experiment using a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate, refine, and debug Python scripts. This directory captures the entire process, from the initial hypothesis and problem context to detailed logs of AI interactions and the resulting code artifacts. Key insights include the capabilities and limitations of AI as a code generation partner, the iterative nature of human-AI collaboration, and the practical challenges encountered during the development of a specific technical solution.

This content is intended for design technologists, technical writers, AI researchers, and anyone interested in the practicalities of integrating AI into technical workflows for design and documentation. It provides the empirical basis for the broader article in the parent directory, `0901-count-that-couldnt`, contributing to discussions on authenticity, efficiency, and the evolving role of AI in technical leadership.
