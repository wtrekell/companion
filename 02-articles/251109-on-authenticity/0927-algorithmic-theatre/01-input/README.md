## About This Content

This collection of input materials documents the exploratory phase for the "Algorithmic Theatre" article, which delves into how AI shapes content creation and the perception of authenticity. The main theme explored here is the practical application of AI in generating and analyzing text, specifically focusing on a multi-stage AI writing process and the subsequent analysis of its characteristics.

The approach involves:
- **AI-assisted drafting:** Conversations with Claude AI demonstrate a structured 5-stage workflow for article generation, emphasizing iterative refinement and the pursuit of "authenticity."
- **Prompt engineering and clarification:** Interactions with ChatGPT highlight the process of refining prompts for specific analytical tools.
- **Custom analytical tools:** Python scripts (`ai-writing-analyzer.py`, `analyzer.py`) were developed to examine AI-generated content or related data.
- **Output analysis:** HTML and JSON files (`ai-tracker.html`, `markup_analysis_results.json`, `analyzer.html`) represent the results or interfaces for these analytical processes.

This content is intended for readers interested in the practicalities of AI integration into creative and analytical workflows, the challenges of defining and measuring authenticity in AI-generated output, and the methodological transparency behind the "Algorithmic Theatre" article. It provides the raw data and process insights that contextualize the broader discussion on design leadership and AI collaboration.
