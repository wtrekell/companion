# You can tune the settings in config.yaml if needed:
#   - pause_threshold: 1.5 for more paragraph breaks (more sensitive)
#  - pause_threshold: 3.0 for fewer breaks (only major topic shifts)
#  - min_paragraph_chars: 50 for shorter paragraphs
#  - min_paragraph_chars: 200 for longer paragraphs
paragraph_detection:
  enabled: true
  pause_threshold: 2.0  # seconds - longer pauses create new paragraphs
  min_paragraph_chars: 100  # minimum characters before allowing paragraph break

# Content Filters (Optional)
# Filters are applied after transcription to determine which audio files to keep
filters:
  max_age_days: null  # Only process audio files modified within N days (null = no age filter)
  include_keywords: []  # Only keep transcriptions containing at least one keyword (supports wildcards: *, ?)
  exclude_keywords: []  # Skip transcriptions containing any of these keywords (supports wildcards: *, ?)

# Example filter configuration:
# filters:
#   max_age_days: 7  # Only process audio files from last 7 days
#   include_keywords:
#     - "meeting"
#     - "interview*"  # Matches "interview", "interviews", etc.
#   exclude_keywords:
