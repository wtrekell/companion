# Templates for Design & Technology Workflows

This directory provides a comprehensive collection of structured markdown templates designed to streamline and standardize documentation across design, product, and technical workflows.

## Summary

This collection offers ready-to-use markdown templates for a wide array of documents, from design briefs and research plans to technical decision records and accessibility audits.

## About This Content

The "Syntax & Empathy Companion" repository emphasizes structured thinking and clear communication in design leadership, AI collaboration, and technical workflows. This `templates` directory is a core component of that philosophy, providing practical tools to operationalize these principles. Each template is crafted to guide users through essential considerations, ensuring critical information is captured, decisions are well-documented, and research is methodically planned and reported. By leveraging these templates, teams can maintain a high standard of documentation, reduce cognitive load, and improve the overall efficiency and transparency of their design and development processes.

## Key Topics

-   **Design Strategy & Planning**: Templates for defining project scope, objectives, requirements, and sprint planning (e.g., Design Brief, Feature Specification, PRD, Design Sprint).
-   **Decision Making & Architecture**: Structured formats for documenting design and architectural decisions, their context, drivers, and implications (e.g., Design Decision, Architecture Decision Record).
-   **User Research & Evaluation**: Tools for planning, executing, and reporting on various research activities, including interviews, usability tests, and persona development (e.g., Research Plan, Interview Guide, Usability Test Plan, Findings Report, User Persona, Journey Map, System Usability Scale).
-   **Accessibility & Compliance**: Checklists and audit templates to ensure products meet accessibility standards (e.g., Accessibility Audit, WCAG Compliance Checklist).
-   **Critique & Feedback**: Formats for conducting structured design critiques to provide constructive feedback (e.g., Design Critique).
-   **Reporting & Portfolio Development**: Templates for creating compelling case studies that highlight impact and process for portfolios or internal reporting (e.g., Impact-Driven Case Study, Portfolio Case Study).
