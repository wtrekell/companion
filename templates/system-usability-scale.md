## Scoring Instructions

To calculate the SUS score:
1. For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9): Subtract 1 from the user response
2. For even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10): Subtract the user response from 5
3. Sum all values and multiply by 2.5
4. This gives a score from 0-100

**Raw Score:** [Sum of processed responses]
**SUS Score:** [Raw score × 2.5] / 100

## Interpretation

| Score Range | Grade | Adjective |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 80-100 | A | Excellent |
| 68-79.9 | B | Good |
| 68 (median) | C | Okay |
| 51-67.9 | D | Poor |
| 0-50.9 | F | Awful |

**This Score:** [X/100] - [Grade] - [Adjective]
