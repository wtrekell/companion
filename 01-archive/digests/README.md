# digests

This directory contains aggregated summaries and structured experiments related to AI-generated content creation, organized by different temporal perspectives.

## Overview

This directory serves as a central hub for various digests and curated views derived from the AI content generation trials documented in the parent `01-archive/` directory. It offers different temporal aggregations and focused project summaries of the content creation experiments, making it easier to review trends, specific project outcomes, and overall learning. It complements the raw archival data by providing curated perspectives, aiding in the analysis and understanding of the "Syntax & Empathy Companion" site's research into AI collaboration.

## Contents

- **by-month/** - Detailed monthly summaries and trials of AI content creation experiments, offering granular insights into ongoing processes and results.
- **by-quarter/** - Documentation of a year-long experiment focused on AI-generated holiday content creation, presented quarterly to track progress and outcomes over a longer period.

## Structure

The subdirectories within `digests/` are organized by the temporal aggregation of the content they contain. `by-month/` provides granular, month-by-month insights into general AI content trials, while `by-quarter/` offers a broader, project-specific quarterly view of a focused experiment.

**Naming Convention:** Subdirectories are named descriptively based on their temporal aggregation or the specific project they cover (e.g., `by-month`, `by-quarter`).

**Content Types:** Visitors will find markdown files containing summaries, analyses, experimental logs, and reflections on AI-generated content trials and projects.

## Navigation

Visitors interested in a granular, month-by-month breakdown of general AI content creation trials should explore the `by-month/` subdirectory. For a focused, longer-term experiment, particularly concerning AI-generated holiday content, `by-quarter/` is the relevant starting point. Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with detailed information and navigation guidance specific to its contents.
